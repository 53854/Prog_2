# 1-collections

This repository is intended to be used as an exercise to get a basic understanding of the `Collection` related data types in `Java`.
One can find `List`, `Set` and `Map` utility classes in the `src/main` package.
No method is implemented yet, but there is `Javadoc`, that describes what a method is supposed to do.
Moreover, the basic structure for `JUnit` tests is already there in the `src/test` package as well.


**Additional Notes**
- For most methods, there are a lot of ways to implement them.
- The `Stream API` may be useful for a lot of methods.
- Also think of exceptions, that might occur and adjust the `Javadoc` if necessary.
