# 4-concurrent-recursion

This repository is intended to showcase different use-cases for recursion
and how concurrency can help us to compute them faster in a 'divide-and-conquer-fashion'
using `Java's` `Fork-Join-APIs`. 

Implemented functions:
- factorial: N -> N
- power: N x N -> N
- fibonacci: N -> N

We also look at computational complexity and different implementation algorithms for the functions.
